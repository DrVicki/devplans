## Plan
>----
> ## Vision
>----
>The first step to creating a strong website is to have a vision for your website. What colors do you want? How are similar websites structured? Let’s do some background ideation together!
> - **Color Palette**
> ![Color Palette](https://github.com/DrVicki/devplans/blob/main/images/DevPlans-Color-Palette.png)
> - Minimalistic Theme.
> - Home, Projects, About, and Contact Navigation Links on Left Side
> - Customizable and scalable
> - [coolors.io](https://coolors.co/)

>----
> ## Purpose
>----
>Before we ever begin, it is wise for us to identify what the purpose of our site is going to be. What will our users be able to do when we are done building this website? Write that here:
> - Designed for developers
> - Keep plans for all projects in one unified location
> - Add new projecs
> - Edit details as projects evolve
> - **Share with Employers**

>----
> ## Research
>----
>Next, it is a good idea to see what others have done similar to what we are about to do. Look up some sites for inspiration. What things do these sites do well? What could they do better? Come up with a few similar sites here and identify their strengths and weaknesses and how this will impact what you build.
> - [Notion](https://www.notion.so/pricing)
>   - Subscription Pricing to be able to share

>----
> ## Design Decisions
>----
>What colors are you going to use? What about fonts? When are you going to use them? Let’s find and keep these safe right now so we can use them when we need them.
> - Color Palette Above
> - Fonts pre-loaded with Docsify

>----
> ## Wireframe
>----
>Now that we’ve done a lot of background work, let’s make a quick wireframe so we know where everything should go when we build it. You can sketch this by hand, or use a few simple rectangle tools to get a quick version down.
> - ![Wireframe](https://github.com/DrVicki/devplans/blob/main/images/DevPlans.drawio.png)
> - [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/)
>----
> ## Main Priority
>----
>These are the things directly related to your purpose and that your website cannot live without. What things do you absolutely need in order for your purpose to be met?
> - Simplistic User-Friendly Home Page and Navigation Links
> - Sub-Navigation links to each project
> - Black project templates ready for next projects

>----
> ## Secondary Priority
>----
>These are still important, but the site would function without them. However, once the main priority things are done, these would be next to complete to make your website really be that much better.
> - Add User Profile
> - Add ability for user to complete each topic with forms.
> - Social Media Share Links

>----
> ## The Dreams
>----
>You’ll probably not get here, but wouldn’t it be great if… These are those cool ideas you would love to do, but know you likely won’t have the time to accomplish. Let’s leave them here. Maybe they will be good to do for a personal project down the road!
> - Add Chat Application
> - Link to Github

>----
> ## Plan to Reality
>----
>Now, take the priorities and turn them into a checklist with what needs to be done. Write that here, and check off the things as you get them done. As you build out the checklist, make sure you are thinking in terms of time and what can be accomplished reasonably with testing.
