> ## Purpose
>----
>Before we ever begin, it is wise for us to identify what the purpose of our site is going to be. What will our users be able to do when we are done building this website? Write that here:
> - Designed for developers
> - Keep plans for all projects in one unified location
> - Add new projecs
> - Edit details as projects evolve
> - **Share with Employers**

>----
> ## Research
>----
>Next, it is a good idea to see what others have done similar to what we are about to do. Look up some sites for inspiration. What things do these sites do well? What could they do better? Come up with a few similar sites here and identify their strengths and weaknesses and how this will impact what you build.
